# Add a new customer


## There are two ways that a new customer can be added to your PowerPanel.
*  The customer can create an account for themself on the login page for your control panel. If you want to enable this look [here](en/account_management/my_customers/create_customer.md)
* You can add a customer in your customer grid view.

To add a customer yourself go to Account Management -&gt; My customers and click on "Add customer"
