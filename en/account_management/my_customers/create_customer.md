# Create new customer

There are two ways that a new customer can be added to your PowerPanel.

The customer can create an account for themself on the login page for your control panel.

* You can add a customer in your customer grid view. You can look here for a guide how to do this.
* You can decide yourself if customers can create their own account for your control panel.

To enable this go to System -> Settings -> Debtor settings and switch on the setting “Allow new registrations”

This enables the button in the next screen

(The screen language is decided by the local of your computer)

If the customer clicks on the registration button the next screen will show up.
