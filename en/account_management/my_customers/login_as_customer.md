# Logging in as a Customer
This article explains how, as a Reseller, you can log in as a Customer. This is useful for when you wish to carry out an action on a customer's behalf.

### 1. Find the customer record

If you already have the customer record open or know how to find it, you may want to skip ahead to the [second part of the article](#login).

You can often find a customer by clicking on the customer's name on an associated record such as a domain record. If you need to search for the customer directly, click on the menu item "Account Management" or "My customers" which is beneath it.

You will then see a table of all your customers. Type the name of the customer into the search box. You should be able to see the customer record in the filtered list. Click on it to open it.

Once you have your customer open, you will see a row of buttons at the bottom of the "Customer Data" section. Click on "Login in as Customer".

A dialog will display showing a "Login Now" button, clicking this button will open a new tab where you will be logged into PowerPanel as the chosen customer.
