### 5. Take care of your images
Using images or other media in the articles gives extra information and make the article easy to read. A few guidelines about images:
- Make sure your images have the same size in the document. 
- Also keep the images small. Large (and high-quality) images are not always needed and load slower, especially on mobile.  
- Make sure the images are clear and the text in the images are readable. Otherwise crop it to the part of the image you want the attention of the reader to.
- Try to keep the image's maximum size to 400px width.
