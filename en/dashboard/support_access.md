# Support Access

Sometimes you need to give your customer a hand with some settings, to prevent that you will have to work with a program like teamviewer or to let you customer give you their credentials you can use the support option in PowerPanel.
In the top right corner you will find the question mark icon.

Your customer can set access to your email address, this email address need to be linked to your PowerPanel account otherwise you will get no access. The customer can set a date to which you have access.
Your customer can also see who has access to his account and revoke that access at any time.

If your customer has given you access to his account you go to the PowerPanel account take over option in the support menu.
Here you will find a list with all the accounts you have access to:

To go to the account of your customer click on the green button behind the name. A new tab will open where you are logged in as your customer.
Note: the session you had in your own account will be overwritten so to access your own account again you will need to logout as your customer and login with your own credentials again.
