# Openprovider domain import

You can import your domain names that are registered at OpenProvider into PowerPanel.

To get your password hash from Openprovider go to Account -> Contact persons and select a contact person that you want to use for PowerPanel.
There you will find the Password hash and you can set the white list for the PowerPanel connection.

If you have done this and enabled the plugin, PowerPanel will retrieve the domain prices and all your domains from your OpenProvider account.

After you have done this you will have to connect the accounts to customers within PowerPanel. To do this go to Domain names -> Domain import

Next you click one or more domainnames you want to connect to a customer. You can choose to use the customer suggested by PowerPanel or look for one yourself.
