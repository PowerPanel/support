### Customer view

After you have set all the forwarder settings your customers can easily create their forwarding by going to a domain which has no hosting package or forwarding active. They will see the green button “Request forwarder”.

When they click on the button the next screen will appear where your customers can enable the forwarding services and enter all the settings.

When your customer has entered all the details the save button will be clickable. When your customer agrees with the settings and saves them the system will create all the forwarders including the needed subscriptions.
If your customer wants to change one of the settings of the forwarder he can go to Hosting -> My forwarder and select the forwarder he wants to change.
