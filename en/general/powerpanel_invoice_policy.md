# Invoicing Policy PowerPanel

PowerPanel sends the invoice for your license in the beginning of each month. Read here how you can choose your license period, you can choose between monthly, quarterly or per year.
The price of your PowerPanel license is based on the number of active subscriptions you have in your account, you can check your price on the license page on our website. An important note here is that we don’t charge afterwards. So if you pay for a year and your business grows in the meantime, you won’t be charged for that growth.

The Payment term for PowerPanel is 7 days. If you don’t pay in time we will hold the right to disable your account, we won’t delete any information, so if you pay your invoice we can enable your account without information loss.
