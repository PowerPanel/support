# Credit management

In PowerPanel you have a tool to assist your on credit management. It is not a default tool in your license, so you will have to activate it manually. 
To do this go to your license settings and activate the module.

Once the module is enabled you can go to Invoices -> Credit Management and see the dashboard

### Settings

In the settings tab you can manage the days after which an action needs to be made. These actions will be done on the days you set yourself. The days you set are the number of days after an invoice will get the status overdue. You can manage the due date in the debtor settings.

In the settings you can also set the default reminder letter and the default collection agency letter. If you want to print out your reminder letters they will get the layout you have set up.

In this screen you can manage the customers who need attention. If a customer has for example an overdue invoice he will appear in this list.
On the right side of the screen you will see the customer details along with the debtor workflow actions.

In the workflow actions you can set a note for yourself that your customer cannot see.
If the customer has to do an action you can enable the switch and choose of one of your predefined actions (or create a new action).The customer will see this action at his details with a red bar.
You can also enable a followup for yourself, if you do this and set a date, the customer will disappear from the list. On the day you set the customer will appear in this list again.

If you scroll down you will see the notes you have set, if they are orange, nothing has yet been done with this note. You can click on the cross to ‘close’ this action and set it to done.
Further down you will see the unpaid invoices for this customer.
