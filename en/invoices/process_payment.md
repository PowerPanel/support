Sometimes a customer pays you directly instead of using the online payment options you offer to them. In that case you can process the payment by hand in PowerPanel.

First look up the customer in the control panel by going to the account management and looking up the customer. After that select the customer invoices.

Look up the invoice that the customer has paid to you.

Click on the process payment option and set the amount that the customer has paid to you.

After youâ€™ve clicked on save, the invoice will be updated with the paid amount and the customer will receive an email that the payment has been received.
