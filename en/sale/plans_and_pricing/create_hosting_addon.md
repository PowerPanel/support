# Create a hosting addon

You can add hosting addons to your hosting plans so that you can sell them with your hosting packages.

Go to Sale -> Plans & Pricing -> Hosting Add-ons to add new hosting add-ons. You can click on the add button to add a new add-on.

We have a few hosting addons available with some logic behind the plugin like the spamexperts plugin, you can install this by simply going to the plugin marketplace and install the plugin with your credentials. If you have enabled the plugin it will appear in the list when you add a new addon.

After you have added the add-on you will see the same settings as with creating a hosting plan.

After you have created your add-on you can add it to a hosting plan. Go to the settings of a hosting plan and look for the add-on screen:

![Hosting addons](/images/hosting_package_addons.png)

Here you can activate the add-on. If the add-on is enabled here it will be automatically included in the order of your customer. If you donâ€™t enable it, your customers can order this add-on in their order process.

All the available plugins are visible at the hosting package detail view.

If a hosting add-on is green, the add-on has a subscription for the customer. If it is grey then the customer can buy the add-on.
