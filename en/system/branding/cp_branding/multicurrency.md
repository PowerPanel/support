You are able to choose your timezone and your default currency symbol. To use the set currency symbol in your invoice template you can use the ‘invoice.price.valuta_symbol_html’ tag with 3 curly brackets around the tag {{{invoice.price.valuta_symbol_html}}}.

You can find all the possible invoice parameters [here.](en/system/settings/invoice_settings/invoice_parameters.md)
