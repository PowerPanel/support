# PowerPanel white label and branding

### White label options and branding settings

As promised PowerPanel is fully white label. There are several options you can edit and manage. One of the most powerful option is the realtime PowerPanel internet address editor. You can choose your own internet address for PowerPanel. Beside this you can setup white label URL options for your customers. You can choose the URL on our free branded PowerPanel subdomain. This is https://mypanel.mypp.io. Or you can add one of your own domain names and SSL certificate and activate a URL and it will look like this: https://cp.myhostingcompany.com. Off course PowerPanel has secure connection so you need to activate a valid SSL certificate.

There are two Branding options. One for the PowerPanel control panel and one for the integrated Webshop. Let’s start with the CP branding!

There are four sections on the page. The first section contains the basic settings. Enter your company name you want to mention on the pages. Also enter your website, support website, phone number and support e-mail address. All this information will be visible in the panel on the designated places.

At the second section you can upload your content like a logo or a background for the logon screen. You can also enter and edit your custom CSS. This will loaded before the main CSS files so you can overwrite the default CSS settings in PowerPanel. [We have a sample CSS file available.](https://cp.powerpanel.io/includes/css/colors.css)

Recommended sizes for the pictures are:
Header logo: 210 x 45 px
Logon logo: 350 x 75px

Now you see the section where you can configure the white label PowerPanel address for your customers. Choose the domain name you want your customers to use. Make sure you have a wildcard SSL certificate loaded because your customers can create subdomains on the domain you choose. In the example below your customers can create addresses like https://company-a.yourpowerpanel.io and https://provider.yourpowerpanel.io. If you don’t want to use this option, leave it blank.

In the last section on this page, you can configure your own PowerPanel address. You can choose your domain and create a free URL or choose your own domain and upload your own SSL certificate to have a more white labeled PowerPanel.

If you use your own URL you need to create a CNAME record in your dns zone that points to our IP address : 52.211.19.240
