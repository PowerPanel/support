# PowerPanel domain forwarder

PowerPanel comes with a free domain forwarding service. With this service you can add a domain name that forwards to another domain.
To set this service up you will have to enable the plugin first, go to the marketplace and look for the plugin ‘PowerPanel forward service’. Install the plugin and enable it.

After you have done this you will have to create a hosting package for the forward service so that your customers can order a forwarder.

To do this create a new hosting package at Sale -> Plans & Pricing -> Hosting Plan and choose the option ‘Forwarder’

If you have created the new hosting package you can manage all the settings for it just as a regular hosting package, so you can set the color, the text, the price etc. When you enable this in the webshop your customers can order a hosting package with a forwarder.
Managing the forwarders can be done at Hosting -> My forwarder.
