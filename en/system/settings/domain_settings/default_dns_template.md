# Default DNS template

If a customer orders a domainname in your webshop, the DNS zone will be filled with a default set of DNS records. You can create your own template that will be used in your webshop.

Go to System -> Settings -> Domain settings and scroll down.

You can edit or delete the current records or add new records.
