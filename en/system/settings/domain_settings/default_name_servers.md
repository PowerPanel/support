# Default Name servers

You can enter your default nameserver in PowerPanel so that it can be used for domainnames that are registered in the webshop.

Go to System -> Settings -> Domain settings and scroll down to the Nameserver settings.

Here you can see the default nameserver with the SOA record. If you don’t know what a SOA record is, please don’t change anything here.
Add a new set by clicking on the button in the bottom right corner and fill in the data in the next screen. You can add an IP address by clicking on the checkbox in the bottomleft.
