# PowerPanel invoice settings

### Invoice settings

After you are logged on to PowerPanel let’s take a look to the “invoice settings“. This page contains three sections. The first section has the basic options. You can setup the way you want the system generates invoices for your customers. You have to make sure the right starting number has entered. If you switch from a billing system to PowerPanel you can enter the last invoice number so the next invoice will created with the correct number.

Make sure you enter your bank account number. This number will be printed on the invoices so your customers know how to pay the invoice. If you want you can setup the cost if your customers wants to get the invoice by regular mail instead of e-mail.

The second section is about the billing policy. The system generates invoices automatically on a time you want. If the invoice has been created you can setup what PowerPanel needs to do. PowerPanel can approve the invoices automatically and send them right away to your customer. If you want to check the invoice first before it’s send out you can disable this option (automatic approval). You can also set some paramaters for this function. For example if the invoice amount is larger dan 100 euro, then you want to check and approve it yourself. For this you need to enable the option “Maximum amount” and enter 100 in the field.
