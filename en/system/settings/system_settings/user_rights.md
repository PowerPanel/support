# User permissions and groups

With User Rights you can control the way your users experience PowerPanel. You control the buttons and menu items that different roles have on their screen.
Almost all the buttons and menu items can be turned off for specific roles.

We have devided the roles into two different groups:
– End user group
– Reseller group

End user groups will have less rights then the reseller groups, the administration settings will be put in one folder instead of a few different menu’s.
The menu for an end user will look like this:

![Menu enduser](/supportpages/images/menu_enduser.png)

The menu for a reseller will look like this:

![Menu reseller](/supportpages/images/menu_reseller.png)

### Adjusting the user rights

To edit the user rights go to System -> Settings -> User rights. Here you will see all the currently available roles, we have built in a few standard roles that can be used.

You can edit the current roles that are not built in, or you can add a new role.
If you add a new role you can choose to copy one of the current available roles to use that one as a base for your new role.

After this you can go and edit the newly added role.

On the left you will find all the menu items that are available, you can click on the arrow to expand a menu item.
If you click on one of the menu items the buttons that are available in that menu will be shown on the right.
To enable one of the menu items or buttons select the checkbox in front of it and click on save.
